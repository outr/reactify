Functional Reactive Properties for observing changes and retaining values

## Concepts

This framework is intentionally meant to be a simplistic take on properties and functional reactive concepts. There are
only four specific classes that really need be understood to take advantage of the framework:

- Observable - As the name suggests it is a simple trait that fires values and may be observed by listeners.
- Channel - The most simplistic representation of an Observable, simply provides a public `:=` to fire events. No state
is maintained.
- Val - Exactly as it is in Scala, this is a final variable. What is defined at construction is immutable. However, the
contents of the value, if they are `Observable` may change the ultimate value of this, so it is is `Observable` itself
and holds state.
- Var - Similar to `Val` except it is mutable as it mixes in `Channel` to allow setting of the current value.

`Val` and `Var` may hold formulas with `Observables`. These `Observables` are listened to when assigned so the wrapping
`Val` or `Var` will also fire an appropriate event. This allows complex values to be built off of other variables.
